# In the configuration above, you can define custom color codes
# and gradients to enhance your chat experience. Each character,
# such as "A", "b", or "C", represents a unique color code that
# can be used in your messages.

# Under the custom section, you can assign a specific hexadecimal
# color value to each character. For example, the character
# "A" represents the color Lime (#55FF55), and the character
# "c" represents the color Red (#CF0000).

custom:
  A:
    color: "#55FF55" # Lime
  b:
    color: "#B2EAF4" # Light Blue 1
  B:
    color: "#B0BFFF" # Light Blue 2
  c:
    color: "#CF0000" # Red
  C:
    color: "#FF55FF" # Light Purple
  D:
    color: "#FFFF55" # Light Yellow
  E:
    color: "#55FFFF" # Aqua
  F:
    color: "#FF55FF" # Pink

# In the gradiant section, you can define gradients using two color codes.
# Each character, like "P", "Q", or "R", represents a unique gradient.
# For example, the gradient defined by "P" transitions from Red (#FF0000) to Green (#00FF00).
